# Device_Tree_Display
This program attempts to display a compiled Device tree file (*.dtb) in a nested set of Qt widgets.
Right now, it's a read-only operation, but the nested display is helpful to me.
On a running Linux system with device tree active, the flattened device tree is in /sys/firmware/fdt.
